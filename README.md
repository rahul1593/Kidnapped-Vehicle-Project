# Kidnapped Vehicle Project
In this project I have implemented a particle filter to localise the car in simulator within acceptable error limits.

This project involves the Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases">here</a>.

__To build the project run the following commands:__
1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./particle_filter

Alternatively some scripts which can be used to clean, build and run project are the following, which are present in the top directory of the project:

1. ./clean.sh
2. ./build.sh
3. ./run.sh
